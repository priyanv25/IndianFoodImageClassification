# IndianFoodImageClassification
Classify indian food images into 12 categories.<br>
### Abstract
  -  The Indian cuisine consists of possibly hundreds of varieties of regional and traditional foods, due to which <br>
food image recognition becomes an essential task. <br>
  -  In this repo we explore a custom-built CNN model and a transfer learning based MobileNetV2 <br>
model for the purpose of food recognition and classification. <br>
  -  A **calorie estimation** algorithm based on image features and nutritional information is proposed, to estimate calories of <br>
the recognized food image. <br>

### DATASET
  - The dataset consists of 12 classes of indian food images. 
  - Each class consists of 70-80 images for training and 30 images for validation.
  *The Train and Test folder consists of  the training and test dataset*
