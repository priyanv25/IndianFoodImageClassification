Classify indian food images into 12 categories.<br>
###Abstract <br>
  -The Indian cuisine consists of possibly hundreds of varieties of regional and traditional foods, due to which <br>
food image recognition becomes an essential task. <br>
  -  In this repo we explore a custom-built CNN model and a transfer learning based MobileNetV2 <br>
model for the purpose of food recognition and classification. <br>
  -  A **calorie estimation** algorithm based on image features and nutritional information is proposed, to estimate calories of <br>
the recognized food image. <br>
